# **Innovation Women ‚Äì Business Challenge III**

Project Overview

This project was developed as part of Business Challenge III for Innovation Women, LLC, a company focused on amplifying underrepresented voices in professional speaking engagements. The team acted as business analysts and strategists to deliver data-driven insights and recommendations for membership acquisition, retention, and financial sustainability.

The analysis aimed to:

Identify patterns of churn, retention, and engagement.

Explore customer acquisition channels and referral patterns.

Conduct financial optimization, including coupon ROI and credit card failure analysis.

Provide actionable recommendations for growth, retention, and sustainable net cash flow.

The deliverables included:

Comprehensive Report ‚Äì with detailed findings, data exploration, segmentation, financial insights, and strategic recommendations
.

Code Notebook ‚Äì containing Python data analysis, cohort tracking, TF-IDF keyword analysis, and geospatial mapping.

Executive Slide Deck ‚Äì summarizing key insights, data visualizations, and recommendations for an executive audience
.

Key Insights

Churn & Retention: Speaker churn is the highest (66%), with ‚Äúmoderate engagement churners‚Äù identified as the most at-risk group. Persona segmentation revealed actionable re-engagement opportunities
.

Acquisition & Geography: States like Massachusetts, California, New York, and Texas have the highest user density but suffer from geographic imbalances between speakers and events
.

Financial Health: Corporate-sponsored users exhibit stronger retention and higher lifetime value compared to individual subscribers. Coupons and discounts boost revenue but must be optimized (fixed-dollar discounts yield higher ROI than percentage-based ones)
.

Payment Failures: Most failures originate from user-side issues. Proactive reminders, Apple/Google Pay integration, and autofill options can reduce failures
.

Speaker-Event Alignment: TF-IDF analysis highlighted mismatches between speaker bios and planner interests. More specific, personalized invitations lead to higher approval rates
.

Deliverables

üíª Notebook: BC3_MBAN2_Group8_code.ipynb ‚Äì Python analysis of churn, financials, and keyword/event gaps.

üìä Slides: MBAN 2 Group 8_slides.pdf ‚Äì Executive presentation summarizing findings and business strategies.

Tools & Methods

Languages & Libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Folium, TF-IDF)

Techniques: Cohort analysis, churn segmentation, TF-IDF keyword analysis, ROI analysis, geospatial mapping, payment recovery analysis.

Visualization: Python charts, maps, and executive slide deck summaries.

Business Recommendations

Persona-Based Retention: Reactivate high-profile churners with targeted offers, gamified onboarding for low-profile users, and improved messaging
.

Regional Campaigns: Launch speaker recruitment in user-dense but speaker-scarce states, aligning events with hotspots
.

Financial Optimization: Redesign marketing packages, prioritize fixed-dollar coupon strategies, and improve Stripe payment recovery workflows
.

Speaker-Event Alignment: Recruit for in-demand topics (mental health, wellness, women in business) and improve keyword tagging for bios and events
.

Platform Intelligence: Build churn prediction models and improve metadata enrichment for smarter event-user matching.
